# COTD:

a expo react native app that allows users to track what color they're associating with their day.

# TODO:

- [x] change the summary screen to show all the calendar days in a scrollable fashion.
- [ ] give a button to allow summary to be presented in different views.
- [ ] consider that it might be cooler to just render a box that is a color starting in the upper left and just blends between the color. I could see that it takes up the whole view space and then as more colors get added, it will start to blend them together, so the first day it will take up the whole page, the second each color gets half, etc...
- [ ] add an export button at the bottom of the summary page
- [ ] add a custom view to the calendar that will allow me to blend between the colors

# Settings Page Todo:

- [ ] Ask how often they'd like push notifications, write the code to remind them once a day
